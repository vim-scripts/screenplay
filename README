The definition of a well formatted screenplay (as I understand it) goes
something like:

<15 spaces>SCENE/ACTION/DESCRIPTIONS (max 54 chars before wrapping)
<37 spaces>CHARACTER NAME
<25 spaces>DIALOG (max 35 chars before wrapping)

It might look like:


             EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

             Rain pissing down. Newspaper KID on street. A man stops
             to listen.

                                   KID
                             (shouting)
                       Extra! Extra! Child labour used to
                       sell newspapers!

Features
========

 * All text is just a tab away from being indented correctly.
   The tab button and the backspace button have been modified to go
   backwards and forwards in helpful chunks  
   Action  == 16 spaces == 1 tab
   Dialog  == 26 spaces == 2 tabs
   Speaker == 38 spaces == 3 tabs

 * The textwidth (tw) variable switches from 68 to 60, when moving from
   ACTION to DIALOG. This ensures good margins.

 * Control-p will re-format a paragraph from under the cursor
   downwards, relative to the (textwidth) margin

 * When you tab three times to type in a character name for DIALOG, and you
   type the first letter of the characters name and then tab again, then you
   will be presented with a choice to autocomplete that characters name.
   (provided you've typed that characters name above a DIALOG at least once
   before).
  
 * Hitting enter after DIALOG should align for a new character name  

 * Hitting enter twice after DIALOG should align for new ACTION block
